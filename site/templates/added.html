    <div class="about">
      <p>This site works by maintaining an index of Java class names to locations on the internet which host relevant Javadocs.</p>
      <p>Users can <a href="add">register</a> additional Javadoc hosts, which will then be indexed. Because all Javadoc hosts are ultimately identified by users of this site, I cannot be responsible for inaccurate or malicious results. If you do find one, please file an issue on this site's <a href="http://github.com/levand/javadoc.zone">Github repository</a> and I'll fix it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>This site is fairly inexpensive to host, but not free. If you find it useful, please buy me a beer as thanks and motivation to keep the site running.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in the tech behind a simple AWS-hosted serverless webapp, please check out the <a href="http://github.com/levand/javadoc.zone">source code</a>. Feedback and PRs welcome.</p>
